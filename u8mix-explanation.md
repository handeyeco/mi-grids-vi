GhatGPT explaining the code I don't undertand:

## U8Mix

This function appears to be a blending or mixing function that combines two values `a` and `b` based on a weight factor `x`. Let's break it down:

### Function Signature

```javascript
function U8Mix(a, b, x)
```

- **`a`**: First value, typically an integer (likely between 0 and 255, as weâ€™ll see).
- **`b`**: Second value, also expected to be an integer, likely between 0 and 255.
- **`x`**: A mixing factor, typically between 0 and 255, that determines how much of `a` and `b` will contribute to the result.

### Inside the Function

```javascript
return (x * b + (0xff - x) * a) >> 8;
```

1. **`x * b`**:

   - This is multiplying the second value `b` by the weight `x`. Essentially, this part of the expression is scaling `b` based on `x`. If `x` is 255 (the maximum value), this term will contribute the full value of `b`.

2. **`(0xFF - x) * a`**:

   - Here, `0xFF` is the hexadecimal notation for `255`, so `0xFF - x` is effectively the complement of `x`. This part scales `a` by the remaining weight (i.e., how much of the blend is coming from `a` as opposed to `b`).
   - If `x` is 255 (meaning all of the blend comes from `b`), then `0xFF - x` is 0, and this term contributes nothing from `a`.
   - Conversely, if `x` is 0 (meaning all of the blend comes from `a`), then `0xFF - x` is 255, and this term contributes the full value of `a`.

3. **`>> 8`**:
   - After the two scaled terms are added together (`x * b + (0xFF - x) * a`), the result is then **right-shifted by 8 bits**. In effect, this divides the result by 256, which brings the value into a range that is compatible with 8-bit values (0 to 255). This is necessary because the result of the multiplication could exceed 255, and we need to ensure it stays within a typical 8-bit range.

### Purpose

This function essentially blends two 8-bit values, `a` and `b`, using `x` as the interpolation factor. The result is a weighted average of `a` and `b`, where the weight is determined by `x`. The right shift (`>> 8`) ensures that the resulting value is within the 0-255 range.

### Example

If `a = 50`, `b = 200`, and `x = 128` (midway between 0 and 255):

- `x * b = 128 * 200 = 25600`
- `(0xFF - x) * a = 127 * 50 = 6350`
- Adding these together: `25600 + 6350 = 31950`
- Right shifting by 8: `31950 >> 8 = 124`

So, the result would be `124`, which is the weighted average of `a` and `b` based on the weight `x`.

### In Summary

The function `U8Mix(a, b, x)` is a way to blend two 8-bit values (`a` and `b`) using a weight factor `x`, producing a result in the range of 0-255. It can be used for tasks like alpha blending in graphics, smooth interpolation, or weighted averaging.

## calculateMixed

The `calculateMixed` function seems to be calculating a "mixed" version of values from a `drum_map` array using a combination of interpolation and blending, as defined by the `U8Mix` function. Let's break it down step-by-step to understand exactly what it's doing.

### Overview of `calculateMixed`

1. **Extract Values from `cv`**:

   ```javascript
   const xpage = cv[3] >> 6;
   const xbalance = (cv[3] << 2) & 0xff;
   const ypage = cv[4] >> 6;
   const ybalance = (cv[4] << 2) & 0xff;
   ```

   - **`cv[3] >> 6`**: Extracts the top 2 bits of `cv[3]` to get `xpage`.
   - **`(cv[3] << 2) & 0xFF`**: Shifts `cv[3]` left by 2 bits and masks with `0xFF` to get `xbalance`. This value is used for blending `a` and `b` in the `U8Mix` function.
   - **`cv[4] >> 6`**: Extracts the top 2 bits of `cv[4]` to get `ypage`.
   - **`(cv[4] << 2) & 0xFF`**: Shifts `cv[4]` left by 2 bits and masks with `0xFF` to get `ybalance`. This value is used for blending `c` and `d` in the `U8Mix` function.

2. **Initialize `mixed` Array**:

   ```javascript
   mixed = [];
   for (i = 0; i < 96; i++) {
   ```

   - The `mixed` array is initialized as an empty array, and then a loop runs for 96 iterations (suggesting that there are 96 values to mix).

3. **Retrieve Values from `drum_map`**:
   For each iteration (`i`):

   ```javascript
   const a = drum_map[(xpage + 0) * 5 + ypage + 0][i];
   const b = drum_map[(xpage + 1) * 5 + ypage + 0][i];
   const c = drum_map[(xpage + 0) * 5 + ypage + 1][i];
   const d = drum_map[(xpage + 1) * 5 + ypage + 1][i];
   ```

   - `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are values from the `drum_map` array at specific indices.
   - The indexing is influenced by `xpage` and `ypage`. The expression `(xpage + 0)` and `(xpage + 1)` select adjacent pages in the `drum_map`. Similarly, `(ypage + 0)` and `(ypage + 1)` select adjacent rows or blocks in the map.
   - The `[i]` at the end of each index accesses the `i`-th element in the row (which is presumably an array of values).

4. **Blend Values Using `U8Mix`**:

   ```javascript
   mixed[i] = U8Mix(U8Mix(a, b, xbalance), U8Mix(c, d, xbalance), ybalance);
   ```

   - **First `U8Mix` Call**:
     - `U8Mix(a, b, xbalance)` blends `a` and `b` using the `xbalance` value (which is based on `cv[3]`).
   - **Second `U8Mix` Call**:
     - `U8Mix(c, d, xbalance)` blends `c` and `d` using the same `xbalance` value.
   - **Final `U8Mix` Call**:
     - After blending `a` and `b`, and `c` and `d`, the results are blended together using the `ybalance` value (which is based on `cv[4]`).

   So, `U8Mix(U8Mix(a, b, xbalance), U8Mix(c, d, xbalance), ybalance)` blends these four values in a two-step process:

   - First, it blends `a` and `b` based on `xbalance`.
   - Then it blends `c` and `d` in the same way.
   - Finally, it blends the results of these two intermediate blends using `ybalance`.

5. **Return Values**:
   ```javascript
   return { xpage, xbalance, ypage, ybalance };
   ```
   - The function returns an object containing the values of `xpage`, `xbalance`, `ypage`, and `ybalance`. This might be useful for debugging or further processing.

### In Summary

The `calculateMixed` function computes a set of "mixed" values based on the `drum_map` array using interpolation. It does this by:

- Extracting `xpage`, `xbalance`, `ypage`, and `ybalance` from `cv`.
- Iterating over 96 positions and selecting four values (`a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`) from the `drum_map` based on `xpage` and `ypage`.
- Using the `U8Mix` function to blend pairs of values (`a` and `b`, `c` and `d`) based on `xbalance` and then blending the resulting intermediate values based on `ybalance`.

The result is an array `mixed` that contains 96 mixed values based on the four neighboring values from the `drum_map` array, with the blending determined by the values from `cv`.
